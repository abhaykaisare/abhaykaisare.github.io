<h1>Bad Decisions = Lost Good Opportunity</h1>

<p>
So Recently I had a Great Opportunity to join a company. I thought too much about it and asked others for there opinions(this is important but there is a saying that too much is too bad
that applies perfectly here) so i didn't attend the interview process itself which i should have even i didn't had to join the company i should have attended the interview
so to make sure i make less mistakes or bad decisions in the future i have found this new framework which sound reasonable for me( I got this from ChatGPT).so this framework
doesn't guarantee you won't make any more bad decisions it can be used to reduce the frequency of your bad decisions.
</p>

<p>
Before getting into the framework, it is important to understand one thing clearly:
most bad decisions are not caused by lack of intelligence, talent, or effort.
They are caused by making decisions in the wrong order, with incomplete information,
or by closing options too early.
</p>

<p>
A useful way to think about decisions is to first classify them instead of directly
trying to evaluate them.
</p>

<h2>Step 1: Classify the Decision</h2>

<p>
Every decision belongs to one of the following two categories.
</p>

<p>
<b>Reversible decisions:</b> interviews, applications, conversations, short experiments,
trying a new skill, attending a meeting, or exploring an opportunity.
These decisions can be undone easily with little cost.
</p>

<p>
<b>Irreversible or costly decisions:</b> signing long-term bonds, committing multiple years,
dropping an academic year, large financial commitments, or locking into a narrow career path.
</p>

<p>
The rule is simple: reversible decisions should be taken quickly,
irreversible decisions should be taken slowly.
Most people do the opposite, and that is where problems start.
</p>

<h2>Step 2: Separate Facts from Assumptions</h2>

<p>
Before deciding, explicitly separate what you know from what you assume.
</p>

<p>
Facts are things you can verify: written terms, official communication,
personal observations, or direct data.
</p>

<p>
Assumptions are things like: “I heard that…”, “probably this will happen”,
or “what if it turns out bad”.
</p>

<p>
A decision made purely on assumptions is not a decision,
it is a guess disguised as analysis.
If assumptions dominate, the correct action is to pause and gather information.
</p>

<h2>Step 3: Reversibility Test</h2>

<p>
Ask a single question:
<b>If this decision turns out to be wrong, how expensive is it to undo?</b>
</p>

<p>
The cost can be time, money, skill decay, or lost opportunities.
If the cost of reversing the decision is low, speed matters more than precision.
If the cost is high, precision matters more than speed.
</p>

<p>
Speed should be inversely proportional to damage.
</p>

<h2>Step 4: Think in Expected Value, Not Fear</h2>

<p>
Instead of asking “What if this goes wrong?”, ask:
</p>

<p>
<b>Expected Value = (Upside × Probability) − (Downside × Probability)</b>
</p>

<p>
Fear exaggerates the probability of failure and ignores upside.
Expected value forces you to look at both sides objectively.
High-upside, low-downside decisions should be taken even if they feel uncomfortable.
</p>

<h2>Step 5: Preserve Option Value</h2>

<p>
Some decisions are valuable even if you do not commit to them.
Interviews, conversations, and trials create information, confidence,
and future leverage.
</p>

<p>
Options should not be destroyed unless keeping them has a real cost.
Rejecting opportunities too early removes future choices and weakens your position.
</p>

<h2>Step 6: Regret Minimization</h2>

<p>
Ask yourself:
<b>Which version of me will regret this less five years from now?</b>
</p>

<p>
In most cases, long-term regret comes from inaction rather than failed attempts.
Trying and failing usually teaches something.
Not trying teaches nothing.
</p>

<h2>Step 7: Set a Decision Deadline</h2>

<p>
Every decision needs a time limit.
Gather the best available information, set a deadline, and decide.
Endless thinking is not careful decision-making, it is avoidance.
</p>

<h2>Step 8: Extract Rules After the Outcome</h2>

<p>
After the result, whether good or bad, ask:
Was the outcome bad, or was the decision process bad?
What rule did I violate or validate?
How do I encode this rule for future decisions?
</p>

<p>
Pain without rule extraction leads to repeated mistakes.
Learning converts failure into progress.
</p>

<h2>The One Rule That Covers Most Cases</h2>

<p>
Never reject a reversible opportunity,
and never rush an irreversible commitment.
</p>

<p>
This framework does not guarantee perfect outcomes.
It reduces avoidable regret and improves long-term decision quality.
Over time, that compounds more than raw intelligence.
