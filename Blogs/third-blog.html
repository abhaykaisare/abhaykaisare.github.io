<h1>Navigating in the magnetic ocean with a compass</h1>

<p>
So you may be confused by the heading of this blog trust me i am more confused about my options in this time. so the magnetic ocean means the amount of opportunities or 
things we can do in the POST AI era.so the compass is our brain which cannot understand the fast rate at which the world is evolving even the great scientists who are 
doing great research are astonished by the pace at which things are evolving.
</p>

<p>
So as a guy in his twenties navigating through this post ai era is very difficult. jobs are not there. even if there are jobs there requirements are so much.the jobs which people
worked so hard to reach no longer exist. only thing which is rising in this days are layoffs.
</p>

<p>
I think of the history as PRE GPT and POST GPT era. with recent announcement of GPT 5 the acceleration the ai space has taken is unbelivable we cannot understand what is happening
new models are getting launched at the speed of light. every one wants to board the ai bus. but no one wants to learn the basic building blocks like linear algebra etc to build the ai.
everything has become so easily available that i cant imagine how would the world look like by the end of this year this is the speed with which thigns are evolving.
</p>

<p>
What all can i do now? : improve communication skills, networkign(human interactions and relations cannot be replaced(yet*).
