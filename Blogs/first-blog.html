<h1>My Initial impressions about AI</h1>

<p>
So a Thought recently crossed my mind.How should we humans use ai? so this is a good question i think 
because i did it wrong way.so it is proven by research that using Ai for normal cognitive tasks insted of thinking is making us bumb.So how what do we do?
</p>

<p>
Lets start with an Analogy so i think that before humans used to walk everywhere atleast for some short distances but since 
the petrol vechicals came and now the EV's. we have forgot to walk so this is bad because as we can see that this has caused a lot of health issues among us.
</p>

<p>
so similarly i think if we don't do our normal cognitive tasks and keep passing everything to ai we may lose our critical thinking ability.so using the analogy you may ask
if you say that we have to walk again then how do we travel long distances? my ans: exactly its best purpose is to use it for long distances if we translate this to
our AI thing it is like taking help of Ai to learn some new skill or upgrade yourself and not relying on it for everything.so AI should be helping you to get the resources
for best learning not doing the tasks themselves.

<p>
By the way i have used AI to create this website and post this. 😅
