<h1>Why I’m Writing</h1>

<p>
Most people write to impress. That usually fails.
</p>

<p>
I’m writing for a different reason: to clarify my own thinking.
If an idea can’t survive plain text, it probably isn’t a good idea.
</p>

<p>
This blog is intentionally simple. No algorithms, no feeds, no optimisation.
Just words, published when they’re ready.
</p>

<p>
If something here is useful to you, that’s a bonus.
If not, the act of writing was still worth it.
</p>
