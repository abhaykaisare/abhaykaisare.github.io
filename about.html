<h1>About</h1>

<p>
I’m Abhay.
</p>

<p>
I study engineering and spend a lot of time thinking about how people learn,
how systems fail, and why most effort is wasted.
</p>

<p>
This site is a personal archive of ideas I don’t want to lose.

<p>
There are no ads, no tracking, and no attempt to grow an audience.
If you’re here, you found it intentionally.
